			<h3>About Us</h3>
			<hr>
			<p>Archer Travel was established in 1952 inside the lobby of the Glendale, CA Greyhound bus terminal by Cliff and Lola Archer. The Archers wanted to provide quality information and affordable travel arrangements for local area residents and friends who wanted to see the world. They wanted to build a business that provided the highest levels of customer service and true value. Today, that commitment to quality and affordability is carried on by the Archer Family.</p>
	 		
	 		<p>Since 1952, Archer Travel has grown in to one of the largest and most respected travel companies in California. Ron Archer, son of the founders, and his wife, Jill, own and operate the company and carry on the tradition of excellence in travel. Today, Archer Travel Service, Inc. is made up of several divisions dedicated to providing value and dependability to tens of thousands of travelers each year.</p>
